        <h1>About the shared task</h1>
        <p >
          Argumentation mining is of great importance for writing assistance, decision making, question answering, and much more. Identifying the stance of an argument towards a particular topic is a fundamental sub-task in argumentation mining. While this sub-task has been tackled before, it has been principally approached in a topic-dependent manner, i.e., given a topic and an argument, predict the stance of the argument towards the topic. As such approach is generally confined by setting a predefined topic in advance, we propose the new task of ‘same side stance classification’: Given two arguments on the same topic, decide whether they have the same or opposite stance towards the topic. <br \> <br \> 
          We welcome you to participate in the task of 'same side stance classification'. We plan to open several calls for system submissions starting from <a href="https://argmining19.webis.de/" target="_blank">the 6th Workshop on Argument Mining at ACL2019</a>, where a discussion of the task and the submissions will take place. This will be followed by ongoing calls of the task at hand in the upcoming venues (e.g., SemEval).

          For now, you can regsiter and access the data. For the first phase,
          participants are required to submit a description of their model and the predicted labels for the provided
          test set. We will use only the <i>accuracy</i> as a metric to compare results. 
      </p>
      <p><strong>Note: </strong>You are not required to submit a paper. Participants should submit only a description about their model(s) and the predicted labels.</p>
